# Gut Microbe Metabolite Interaction

The repository provides data driven approach for generating negative dataset and random forest binary classification models for substrate, product, consumption and production predictions

Four classification models are provided in this repository:

1. Brenda Substrate Prediction
2. Brenda Product Prediction
3. Metabolite consumption by gut microbes
4. Metabolite production by gut microbes

## Dependencies
1. pandas 1.1.3
2. sklearn 0.23.2
